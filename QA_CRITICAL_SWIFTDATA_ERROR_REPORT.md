# DashPay iOS QA Test Report - Critical SwiftData Error

## Executive Summary
The app builds successfully but crashes immediately on launch due to a SwiftData model context error when trying to establish relationships between models.

## Critical Issue Found

### 1. Fatal SwiftData Context Error
**Severity**: CRITICAL - App crashes on launch
**Location**: `WalletService.swift` line 948 in `updateAccountBalance` method

**Error Message**:
```
Fatal error: attempting to relate model - PersistentIdentifier(HDWatchedAddress) 
with model context - SwiftData.ModelContext to destination model - Balance 
from destination's model context
```

**Root Cause**:
The error occurs when trying to update balance from within a MainActor.run block while passing a model context from outside the block. This creates a context mismatch when SwiftData tries to establish the relationship between HDWatchedAddress and Balance models.

**Code Location**:
```swift
// In WalletService.swift, line 945-952
await MainActor.run {
    do {
        // This line causes the crash - modelContext is from outside MainActor
        try address.updateBalanceSafely(from: balance, in: modelContext!)
    } catch {
        logger.error("Failed to update address balance: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Testing Progress

### What Was Tested:
1. ✅ Build process - Successful
2. ✅ App installation on simulator - Successful
3. ❌ App launch - **FAILED** (crashes immediately)

### What Could NOT Be Tested (Due to Launch Crash):
1. ❌ Wallet creation flow
2. ❌ Wallet import flow  
3. ❌ Balance display and updates
4. ❌ Blockchain sync functionality
5. ❌ Mempool tracking
6. ❌ Transaction history
7. ❌ Data persistence
8. ❌ Account management
9. ❌ UI responsiveness

## Technical Analysis

### Context Threading Issue:
The crash occurs because:
1. `modelContext` is captured from the WalletService instance
2. Inside `MainActor.run`, a new execution context is created
3. SwiftData doesn't allow relating models across different contexts
4. The Balance model is being inserted in one context but related to an HDWatchedAddress in another

### Related Code Patterns Found:
Similar patterns that may cause issues:
- Line 965-973: Another MainActor.run block updating account balance
- Line 264-280 in HDWalletModels.swift: createOrUpdateBalance marked with @MainActor

## Immediate Fix Required

The code needs to be refactored to ensure all SwiftData operations for related models happen in the same context. Options include:

1. Move the entire updateAccountBalance method to @MainActor
2. Create the Balance object outside MainActor.run and only update UI properties inside
3. Use a different approach for thread-safe balance updates

## Console Logs
The app generates numerous CoreData background task logs before crashing, indicating heavy database activity:
```
[com.apple.UIKit:BackgroundTask] Creating new background assertion
[com.apple.UIKit:BackgroundTask] Created background task: CoreData: Executing write request
```

## Current App State
- **Build Status**: ✅ Successful
- **Launch Status**: ❌ Crashes immediately
- **Error Type**: SwiftData model context mismatch
- **User Impact**: App is completely unusable

## Next Steps
1. Fix the SwiftData context issue in WalletService
2. Review all MainActor.run blocks that interact with SwiftData
3. Ensure consistent context usage across the app
4. Re-test once fixes are applied

## Testing Environment
- Xcode Version: 16F6
- Simulator: iPhone 16 Pro
- iOS Version: 18.5
- Build Configuration: Debug
