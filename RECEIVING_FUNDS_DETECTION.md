- **Key Features**:
  - Transaction direction logging
  - Balance change tracking
  - Address activity timestamps
  - Error logging and debugging

## Core Implementation Details

### Transaction Event Flow

1. **SPV Client** detects transaction â†’ 
2. **WalletService.handleSDKEvent()** processes event â†’
3. **Address ownership check** determines if transaction involves wallet â†’
4. **Transaction direction detection** (sent/received) â†’
5. **Notification system** triggers visual and push notifications â†’
6. **Transaction persistence** saves to local database â†’
7. **Balance update** refreshes account balance â†’
8. **UI refresh** updates all relevant views

### Notification System Architecture

```
SPV Event â†’ WalletService â†’ NotificationCenter â†’ Multiple Subscribers:
                                                â”œâ”€â”€ TransactionNotificationManager (visual)
                                                â”œâ”€â”€ LocalNotificationService (push)
                                                â””â”€â”€ UI Components (real-time updates)
```

### Testing Framework

The implementation includes a comprehensive testing system:

- **Test Method**: `WalletService.testReceivingFundsDetection()`
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Address generation
  - Transaction simulation
  - Notification system
  - Activity tracking
  - Balance updates
  - Confirmation handling

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically detects incoming funds
2. **Visual Feedback**: Notification banners appear at the top of the screen
3. **Push Notifications**: Local notifications are sent even when app is in background
4. **Address Activity**: Receive address view shows recent activity indicators

### For Developers
1. **Enable Notifications**: Ensure `LocalNotificationService` is initialized in app startup
2. **Test System**: Use the "ðŸ§ª Test Receiving Funds" button in the dashboard menu
3. **Debug Logging**: Monitor console output for detailed transaction logs
4. **Customization**: Modify notification content and timing in respective service files

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created
- `DashPayiOS/Shared/Views/TransactionNotificationBanner.swift`
- `DashPayiOS/Core/Views/EnhancedReceiveAddressView.swift`
- `DashPayiOS/Core/Services/LocalNotificationService.swift`

### Files Modified
- `DashPayiOS/Core/Services/WalletService.swift` (enhanced event handling and balance updates)
- `DashPayiOS/Core/Models/HDWalletModels.swift` (added lastActivityTimestamp property)
- `DashPayiOS/Shared/Views/UnifiedDashboardView.swift` (added notification overlay and test button)
- `DashPayiOS/Shared/Models/UnifiedStateManager.swift` (added sync completion notifications)
- `DashPayiOS/App/DashPayApp.swift` (notification delegate setup)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### SPV Event Processing
- Events are processed on background threads and marshaled to MainActor for UI updates
- Transaction filtering ensures only wallet-relevant transactions trigger notifications
- Comprehensive logging provides full audit trail of all events

### Real-time UI Updates
- `objectWillChange.send()` forces immediate SwiftUI updates
- NotificationCenter provides loose coupling between services
- Activity indicators update based on recent transaction timestamps

### Notification Management
- Local notifications respect user authorization preferences
- Notification queue prevents spam during high transaction volume
- Badge counts track unread transaction notifications

### Testing & Debugging
- Comprehensive test suite simulates entire transaction flow
- Detailed logging with emoji indicators for easy console reading
- Mock transaction generation for development testing

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:

1. **Address Labels**: Custom labels for receive addresses
2. **Transaction Categories**: Categorize transactions by type/source
3. **Sound Customization**: Custom notification sounds
4. **Filtering Options**: Filter notifications by amount thresholds
5. **Analytics**: Track transaction patterns and statistics
6. **Multi-account Support**: Enhanced support for multiple HD accounts
