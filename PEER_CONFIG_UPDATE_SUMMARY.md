# DashPay iOS Peer Configuration Update Summary

## Changes Made

Updated the dashpay-ios app to use direct IP addresses for peer configuration instead of DNS seeds, matching the working implementation in rust-dashcore/swift.

### File Modified
- `/Users/quantum/src/dashpay-ios/SwiftDashCoreSDK_backup/Core/SPVClientConfiguration.swift`

### Specific Changes

1. **Mainnet Configuration** (lines 297-310):
   - Replaced DNS seeds with direct IP addresses:
     - Removed: `"seed.dash.org:9999"`, `"dnsseed.dash.org:9999"`, `"seed.dashdot.io:9999"`, `"seed.masternode.io:9999"`
     - Added: `"142.93.154.186:9999"`, `"8.219.251.8:9999"`, `"165.22.30.195:9999"`, `"65.109.114.212:9999"`, `"188.40.21.248:9999"`, `"66.42.58.154:9999"`

2. **Testnet Configuration** (lines 312-329):
   - Replaced DNS seeds with direct IP addresses:
     - Removed: `"testnet-seed.dash.org:19999"`, `"testnet.dnsseed.dash.org:19999"`, `"seed-1.testnet.networks.dash.org:19999"`, etc.
     - Added: `"192.168.1.137:19999"`, `"54.149.33.167:19999"`, `"35.90.252.3:19999"`, `"18.237.170.32:19999"`, `"34.220.243.24:19999"`, `"34.214.48.68:19999"`

3. **Devnet Configuration** (lines 342-351):
   - Replaced DNS seed with placeholder IP:
     - Removed: `"devnet-seed.dash.org:19799"`
     - Added: `"127.0.0.1:19799"` (placeholder - devnet requires specific configuration)

## Rationale

The rust-dashcore implementation successfully uses direct IP addresses for peer connections, avoiding potential DNS resolution issues. By matching this approach in dashpay-ios, we ensure:

1. Faster connection establishment (no DNS lookup required)
2. More reliable connections (no dependency on DNS servers)
3. Consistency with the working rust-dashcore implementation
4. Better debugging (explicit IP addresses in logs)

## Testing

The changes have been verified:
- ✅ All DNS seed addresses removed
- ✅ Direct IP addresses added for mainnet
- ✅ Direct IP addresses added for testnet
- ✅ Configuration file syntax remains valid

## Next Steps

1. Build the project to ensure compilation succeeds
2. Test network connectivity with the new peer configuration
3. Monitor connection logs to verify peers connect using the IP addresses
4. Consider adding more peer IPs for redundancy if needed
