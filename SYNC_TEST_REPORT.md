# Core Chain Sync Test Report

## Test Summary

### Environment
- **Device**: iPhone 16 Pro Simulator
- **iOS Version**: 18.5
- **Testnet Node**: 192.168.1.163:19999 (local)
- **Build Date**: June 28, 2025

### Test Steps Completed

1. **Project Regeneration**
   - Successfully regenerated Xcode project using xcodegen
   - Build configuration properly set up with FFI libraries

2. **Build Process**
   - Project builds successfully with warnings about duplicate symbols (expected)
   - All FFI libraries properly linked:
     - libdash_spv_ffi_sim_renamed.a
     - libkey_wallet_ffi_sim.a
     - librs_sdk_ffi_renamed.a

3. **Configuration Changes**
   - Modified AppState.swift to use real Core SDK initialization (removed mock mode)
   - Added testnet node configuration (192.168.1.163:19999)
   - Enabled blockchain sync in AppState

4. **Current Status**
   - App launches successfully
   - FFI libraries are present and properly linked
   - Initialization fails with: "Core SDK not available from Platform AppState"

### Issue Analysis

The initialization is failing at the UnifiedAppState level where it tries to retrieve the Core SDK from the Platform AppState. The issue appears to be:

1. The Platform AppState's `initializeSDK()` method is being called
2. The Core SDK initialization (`DashSDK(configuration: coreConfig)`) might be failing
3. The error is not being properly propagated to the UI

### Potential Root Causes

1. **FFI Initialization Timing**: The FFI might not be fully initialized when DashSDK tries to use it
2. **Thread Safety**: The initialization might be happening on the wrong thread
3. **Configuration Issue**: The SPVClientConfiguration might have issues
4. **Network Connection**: The testnet node might not be reachable

### Next Steps to Debug

1. Add console logging to capture the actual initialization error
2. Test network connectivity to 192.168.1.163:19999
3. Try initializing with public testnet nodes first
4. Add error handling in DashSDK initialization to capture specific FFI errors
5. Consider adding a delay after FFI initialization before creating DashSDK

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Add try-catch blocks around DashSDK initialization with detailed error logging
2. **Short-term**: Create a diagnostic view that shows FFI initialization status
3. **Long-term**: Implement proper error recovery and retry mechanisms

## Conclusion

The Core chain sync functionality is properly configured but fails during initialization. The FFI integration appears to be the critical point of failure. The app structure and configuration are correct, but the runtime initialization sequence needs debugging.
