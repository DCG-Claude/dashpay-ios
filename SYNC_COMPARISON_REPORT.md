# DashPay iOS vs Working Example App Comparison Report

## Date: 2025-06-30

## Overview
This report compares the DashPay iOS app with the working example app from rust-dashcore to identify why sync works in the example but not in DashPay iOS.

## Key Findings

### 1. Library Differences

#### Working Example App (rust-dashcore)
- Uses libraries directly from the build output
- Libraries: `libdash_spv_ffi_sim.a` and `libkey_wallet_ffi_sim.a`
- Linked directly in Xcode project

#### DashPay iOS App
- Uses renamed libraries to avoid symbol conflicts
- Libraries: `libdash_spv_ffi_sim_renamed.a` and `libkey_wallet_ffi_sim_renamed.a`
- Also has an xcframework with additional renamed libraries

### 2. SDK Initialization Differences

#### Working Example App
```swift
// Simple initialization
sdk = try await MainActor.run {
    try DashSDK(configuration: config)
}
```

#### DashPay iOS App
```swift
// Uses SPVClientFactory abstraction
sdk = try await MainActor.run {
    logger.info("   Thread in MainActor: \(Thread.isMainThread ? "Main" : "Background")")
    logger.info("   Creating DashSDK instance...")
    let newSDK = try DashSDK(configuration: config)
    logger.info("   âœ… DashSDK instance created successfully")
    return newSDK
}
```

### 3. Configuration Differences

Both apps use similar configuration, but DashPay iOS has more extensive logging and error handling.

#### Common Configuration
- Network: Testnet/Mainnet
- Validation Mode: Full
- Mempool Config: FetchAll strategy
- Log Level: "trace" (in example app)

#### DashPay iOS Additions
- Support for local/public peer switching
- Extensive connection diagnostics
- Auto-sync functionality
- Force resync capabilities

### 4. Peer Configuration

Both apps use the same peer configuration approach:

#### Testnet Peers (both apps)
```swift
config.additionalPeers = [
    "43.229.77.46:19999",
    "45.77.167.247:19999",
    "178.62.203.249:19999"
]
```

### 5. Key Differences That May Affect Sync

1. **Library Renaming**: DashPay iOS uses renamed libraries to avoid symbol conflicts, which might cause FFI issues
2. **Additional Abstraction**: SPVClientFactory adds a layer that might interfere with initialization
3. **Threading**: Both use MainActor, but DashPay has more complex threading logic
4. **Error Handling**: DashPay has extensive error handling that might mask underlying issues

## Recommendations

### 1. Test with Original Libraries
Try using the non-renamed libraries (`libdash_spv_ffi_sim.a` instead of `libdash_spv_ffi_sim_renamed.a`) to rule out symbol renaming issues.

### 2. Simplify Initialization
Remove the SPVClientFactory abstraction and initialize DashSDK directly like the example app.

### 3. Check FFI Symbol Resolution
The renamed libraries might have broken FFI symbol resolution. Check if the FFI functions are being called correctly.

### 4. Verify Library Loading
Add logging to verify that the FFI libraries are being loaded and initialized properly.

### 5. Compare Build Settings
Check if there are any build setting differences that might affect library loading or linking.

## Next Steps

1. Create a minimal test that uses the original (non-renamed) libraries
2. Add FFI initialization logging to see where the connection fails
3. Compare the actual network traffic between the two apps
4. Test if removing the SPVClientFactory abstraction helps

## Conclusion

The most likely cause of the sync issue is the library renaming process, which may have broken the FFI symbol resolution needed for the Rust code to communicate with Swift. The working example uses the original library names, while DashPay iOS uses renamed libraries to avoid conflicts.
