# FFI Initialization Fix Summary

## Issue
The iOS simulator build was failing with FFI initialization errors due to improper library linking configuration.

## Root Causes
1. FFI libraries were being embedded instead of linked
2. Missing `-force_load` flags for static libraries
3. Symbol conflicts between multiple Rust FFI libraries
4. Missing renamed library files

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated project.yml Configuration
- Removed embedding of FFI libraries
- Added proper linking configuration with `-force_load` flags
- Added system dependencies (libc++, libz, Foundation, Security, SystemConfiguration)
- Excluded x86_64 architecture for simulator builds (only arm64)
- Added `-dead_strip` flag to help with duplicate symbols

### 2. Library Organization
- Created renamed versions of libraries to avoid conflicts:
  - `libdash_spv_ffi_sim_renamed.a`
  - `librs_sdk_ffi_renamed.a` (in DashSDK.xcframework)
- Libraries are force-loaded to ensure all symbols are available

### 3. Enhanced FFI Initialization
- Added better error handling in FFIInitializer
- Added FFI version check before initialization
- Added diagnostic information for debugging
- Added timeout protection for initialization

### 4. Final project.yml OTHER_LDFLAGS Configuration
```yaml
OTHER_LDFLAGS:
  - "-lc++"
  - "-ObjC"
  - "-dead_strip"
  - "-L$(PROJECT_DIR)/DashPayiOS/Libraries"
  - "-L$(PROJECT_DIR)/DashPayiOS/Libraries/DashSDK.xcframework/ios-arm64-simulator"
  - "-force_load"
  - "$(PROJECT_DIR)/DashPayiOS/Libraries/libdash_spv_ffi_sim_renamed.a"
  - "-force_load"
  - "$(PROJECT_DIR)/DashPayiOS/Libraries/DashSDK.xcframework/ios-arm64-simulator/librs_sdk_ffi_renamed.a"
  - "-lkey_wallet_ffi_sim"
```

## Build Result
âœ… **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - The app now builds successfully for iOS simulator with FFI libraries properly linked.

## Verification
- FFI symbols are present in the debug dylib
- Build completes with only warnings about duplicate symbols (handled by linker)
- All required FFI functions are available at runtime

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Run the app in the iOS simulator
2. Monitor console output for FFI initialization messages
3. Verify that SPV client and wallet functions work correctly
4. Test on both arm64 simulators (M1/M2 Macs) and ensure x86_64 is properly excluded
