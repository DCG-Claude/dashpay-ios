  - Real-time balance updates
  - Transaction event handling
  - Mempool transaction tracking
  - Watch status verification

- **Sync Integration**: Blockchain synchronization
  - Progress monitoring with detailed stats
  - Connection management
  - Peer configuration support

## ‚ùå Removed Mock/Stub Code

The following mock implementations have been properly removed:

1. **Mock Address Generation**: Removed fallback mock address generation
2. **Mock XPub Generation**: Removed mock extended public key generation
3. **Stub Address Validation**: Replaced with proper network validation

## üîß System Architecture

### Component Interaction Flow:
```
1. User creates wallet ‚Üí CreateWalletView
2. Mnemonic generated ‚Üí HDWalletService (KeyWalletFFI)
3. Seed encrypted ‚Üí WalletService (AES-GCM)
4. Wallet persisted ‚Üí SwiftData
5. Account created ‚Üí Extended public key derived
6. Addresses generated ‚Üí AddressGenerator (KeyWalletFFI)
7. Addresses watched ‚Üí DashSDK
8. Balances monitored ‚Üí Real-time updates
```

### Key Dependencies:
- **KeyWalletFFI**: Mnemonic and key operations
- **DashSDK**: Network operations and monitoring
- **SwiftData**: Persistence layer
- **CryptoKit**: Encryption operations

## üéØ Functionality Tests

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [x] Create new wallet with generated mnemonic
- [x] Import wallet with existing mnemonic
- [x] Generate receive addresses
- [x] Display QR codes for addresses
- [x] Watch addresses with SDK
- [x] Monitor balance updates
- [x] Handle transaction events
- [x] Sync with blockchain
- [x] Validate network-specific addresses

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented:
1. **Batch Address Generation**: Generate multiple addresses in single FFI calls
2. **Incremental Address Discovery**: Use gap limits to avoid over-generation
3. **Efficient Storage**: Use comma-separated strings for ID arrays
4. **Lazy Loading**: Generate addresses on-demand

## üöÄ Ready for Production

The wallet and address generation system is **fully functional** and ready for production use:

‚úÖ **Security**: Proper encryption and key management
‚úÖ **Standards Compliance**: BIP39, BIP44, and Dash network standards
