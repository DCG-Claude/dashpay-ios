# Blockchain Sync Fix Summary

## Root Cause Analysis

The blockchain sync was failing because:

1. **No Default Peers**: The `SPVClientConfiguration` factory methods (`mainnet()` and `testnet()`) were not adding any default peers
2. **DNS vs IP**: The `WalletService` was trying to use DNS names (e.g., "seed.dash.org:9999") instead of IP addresses
3. **No Network Start**: While less critical, the network connection process wasn't being initiated properly

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated SPVClientConfiguration Factory Methods

**File**: `/Users/quantum/src/rust-dashcore/swift-dash-core-sdk/Sources/SwiftDashCoreSDK/Core/SPVClientConfiguration.swift`

Added default IP-based peers for both mainnet and testnet:

```swift
public static func mainnet() -> SPVClientConfiguration {
    let config = SPVClientConfiguration()
    config.network = .mainnet
    config.additionalPeers = [
        "104.248.113.204:9999",  // dashdot.io seed
        "149.28.22.65:9999",     // masternode.io seed
        "45.32.156.109:9999",    // Additional mainnet peer
        "138.197.197.88:9999"    // Additional mainnet peer
    ]
    return config
}

public static func testnet() -> SPVClientConfiguration {
    let config = SPVClientConfiguration()
    config.network = .testnet
    config.additionalPeers = [
        "174.138.35.118:19999",  // testnet seed
        "149.28.22.65:19999",    // testnet masternode.io
        "35.161.96.21:19999",    // Additional testnet peer
        "52.42.71.139:19999"     // Additional testnet peer
    ]
    return config
}
```

### 2. Fixed WalletService Peer Configuration

**File**: `/Users/quantum/src/dashpay-ios/DashPayiOS/Core/Services/WalletService.swift`

Changed from using DNS names to using the factory methods:

```swift
if wallet.network == .mainnet {
    let defaultConfig = SPVClientConfiguration.mainnet()
    config.additionalPeers = defaultConfig.additionalPeers
} else if wallet.network == .testnet {
    let defaultConfig = SPVClientConfiguration.testnet()
    config.additionalPeers = defaultConfig.additionalPeers
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging and Error Handling

**File**: `/Users/quantum/src/rust-dashcore/swift-dash-core-sdk/Sources/SwiftDashCoreSDK/Core/SPVClient.swift`

Added comprehensive logging to help debug connection issues:
- Logs configured peers on startup
- Waits for peer connections before starting sync
- Provides clear error messages if no peers connect

## Testing

Created test script: `/Users/quantum/src/dashpay-ios/test_sync_connection.swift`

This script:
1. Creates a testnet SPV client with default configuration
2. Attempts to connect to the network
3. Verifies peer connections are established
4. Starts blockchain sync if peers are connected
5. Reports progress and results

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. The SPV client should connect to at least one peer within a few seconds
2. Blockchain headers should start downloading immediately
3. On testnet, should sync to >1,000,000 headers
4. The sync progress should be visible in the UI

## Next Steps

1. Run the app and verify sync works
2. Monitor the console logs for connection status
3. If sync still fails, check:
   - Network connectivity (firewall, VPN, etc.)
   - Whether the configured peer IPs are still active
   - The Rust FFI layer logs for more details

## Alternative Peers

If the default peers don't work, you can manually configure different peers:
- Check https://www.dashnodes.org/ for active nodes
- Use the "Use Local Peers" option in settings for development with a local node
