### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling for:
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid contract IDs
- Contract not found scenarios
- Platform protocol errors
- Serialization/deserialization failures

### Memory Management

- Automatic FFI resource cleanup using `FFIHelpers`
- Safe pointer handling for C string conversions
- Proper error object disposal

## Well-Known Contracts Registry

### Built-in Contracts

1. **DPNS (Dash Platform Name Service)**
   - ID: `GWRSAVFMjXx8HpQFaNJMqBV7MBgMK4br5UESsB4S31Ec`
   - Document Types: domain, preorder
   - Purpose: Decentralized domain registration

2. **DashPay**
   - ID: `Bwr4jHXb7vtJEKjGgajQzHk7aMXWvNJUAfZXgvFtB5yM`
