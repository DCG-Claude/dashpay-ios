# Critical Sync Fixes Applied to DashPay iOS

## Summary
Fixed the blockchain sync issue that was stuck at 0% by replacing test sync with production sync implementation and adding proper event callbacks.

## Critical Files Modified

### 1. `DashPayiOS/SwiftDashCoreSDK/Core/SPVClient.swift`

#### Key Changes
1. **Added Rust Logging Initialization**
   ```swift
   // In init()
   let logResult = FFIBridge.withCString(configuration.logLevel) { logLevel in
       dash_spv_ffi_init_logging(logLevel)
   }
   ```

2. **Replaced Test Sync with Production Sync**
   - Before: `dash_spv_ffi_client_test_sync(ffiClient)`
   - After: `dash_spv_ffi_client_sync_to_tip(client, syncCompletionCallback, userData)`

3. **Added Event Callbacks Infrastructure**
   - Added callback holder classes: `CallbackHolder`, `DetailedCallbackHolder`, `EventCallbackHolder`
   - Implemented all event callbacks: `eventBlockCallback`, `eventTransactionCallback`, `eventBalanceCallback`, etc.
   - Added `setupEventCallbacks()` method called during client start

4. **Fixed Watch Item Implementation**
   - Now uses proper FFI functions: `dash_spv_ffi_watch_item_address/script/outpoint`
   - Added proper memory management with `dash_spv_ffi_watch_item_destroy`

5. **Added Missing Methods**
   - `getCurrentSyncProgress()` - retrieves current sync state from FFI

## Root Cause
The sync was stuck at 0% because:
1. The app was using `dash_spv_ffi_client_test_sync` which is a test-only function that doesn't connect to real peers
2. No event callbacks were registered, preventing sync progress updates
3. Rust logging wasn't initialized, making debugging difficult

## Expected Behavior After Fixes
1. The SPV client will now connect to real Dash network peers
2. Sync progress will be properly tracked and reported via callbacks
3. Block headers will be downloaded and validated
4. Events (blocks, transactions, balance updates) will be properly propagated
5. Sync should progress beyond 0% and eventually reach 100%

## Testing Required
1. Build and run the app
2. Monitor console logs for Rust SPV client output
3. Verify sync progress increases from 0%
4. Check that peer connections are established
5. Confirm block headers are being downloaded

## Additional Notes
- The network configuration already includes seed nodes for mainnet/testnet
- Data persistence directory is properly configured
- Memory management for callbacks has been implemented correctly
- All callback signatures now match the C header definitions
