# FFI Investigation Summary

## Hypothesis
The FFI functions are not being properly initialized or linked at runtime, preventing the SPV client from starting.

## Investigation Results

### 1. FFI Initialization Status: âœ… WORKING

The FFI functions ARE being properly initialized. Evidence from app logs:

```
ðŸ”§ Initializing Rust FFI logging...
âœ… Rust logging initialized with level: info
âœ… FFI config created successfully
```

### 2. Issue Found: Missing FFIInitializer Class

The custom `SPVClientFactory.swift` was referencing a non-existent `FFIInitializer` class:
```swift
if !FFIInitializer.initialized {
    // This class doesn't exist in the current codebase
}
```

**Fix Applied**: Removed the FFIInitializer dependency from SPVClientFactory.swift

### 3. FFI Library Status: âœ… PROPERLY LINKED

- The `libdash_spv_ffi.a` library exists and contains all required symbols
- Verified symbols: `dash_spv_ffi_init_logging`, `dash_spv_ffi_config_new`, etc.
- The library is properly linked via Swift Package Manager

### 4. Current Status

The FFI is working correctly:
1. Logging initialization: âœ…
2. Config creation: âœ… 
3. Peer addition: âœ… (except for "localhost" which has invalid syntax)

### 5. Duplicate Symbol Warnings

There are duplicate symbols between:
- `librs_sdk_ffi.a` (Platform SDK)
- `libdash_spv_ffi_sim.a` (Core SPV)

These warnings don't prevent the app from running but should be addressed.

## Conclusion

The FFI functions ARE properly initialized and working. The issue was:
1. A reference to a non-existent FFIInitializer class (now fixed)
2. The app is successfully creating SPV configurations and adding peers

The SPV client appears to be starting correctly based on the logs. Any sync issues are likely not related to FFI initialization.
