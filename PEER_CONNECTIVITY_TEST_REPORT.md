# Peer Connectivity Test Report

## Test Date: June 28, 2025

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - The app compiled successfully with the peer connectivity fixes

## Test Environment
- Simulator: iPhone 16 (iOS 18.5)
- Network: Testnet
- Build Configuration: Debug

## Test Results

### 1. App Launch
✅ App launches successfully
- Screenshot: `test_peer_connectivity_launch.png`

### 2. Wallet Creation
✅ Successfully created a new wallet ("Dev Wallet 4363")
- Network: Testnet
- Password protection enabled
- Recovery phrase generated

### 3. Sync Status Testing
⚠️ **Manual UI Interaction Required**
- Unable to fully automate UI interaction through command line
- Need manual testing to verify sync progress

## Key Changes Verified

### Peer Configuration Changes
The following changes were implemented in the codebase:

1. **Removed Hardcoded Local Peer** (`DashPayApp.swift`)
   - Removed: `config.additionalPeers = ["192.168.1.163:19999"]`
   - Result: App now respects peer configuration settings

2. **Flexible Local Peer Configuration** (`WalletService.swift`)
   - Changed hardcoded IP to configurable host via UserDefaults
   - Default local peer: `127.0.0.1` (localhost)
   - Added methods for custom local peer configuration

3. **Enhanced Settings UI** (`SettingsView.swift`)
   - Shows current local peer host
   - Warning message for local peer usage
   - Toggle between public and local peers

4. **Default to Public Peers**
   - First-launch detection ensures public peers are used by default
   - New installations automatically connect to Dash network peers

## Recommendations for Manual Testing

To complete the peer connectivity verification:

1. **Open the app in the simulator**
2. **Click on "Dev Wallet 4363"** to open wallet details
3. **Look for sync progress indicator**
   - Should show percentage > 0%
   - Should show "Downloading headers" or similar status
4. **Go to Settings tab**
   - Verify "Use Local Peers" is OFF (default)
   - Check local peer host shows "127.0.0.1"
5. **Monitor Console logs** for:
   - "Connected to X peers" messages
   - Header download progress
   - No "192.168.1.163" connection attempts

## Build Logs
- Full build log: `build_peer_test3.log`
- Build completed successfully with warnings but no errors

## Known Issues
- Some Swift 6 compatibility warnings (non-critical)
- Automated UI testing limitations in command-line environment

## Conclusion
The peer connectivity fix has been successfully implemented and the app builds correctly. Manual testing is required to fully verify that:
1. The app connects to public testnet peers by default
2. Sync progresses past 0%
3. Headers start downloading
4. No hardcoded local peer blocks the connection

The code changes are in place and the app is ready for manual sync verification.
