# Manual Testing Instructions for Peer Connectivity

## Current Status
- ✅ App builds successfully with peer connectivity fixes
- ✅ Wallet created successfully (Dev Wallet 4363)
- ⚠️ Need manual verification of sync progress

## Steps to Complete Testing

### 1. Open the Simulator
The app is already running in the iPhone 16 simulator.

### 2. Navigate to Wallet Details
1. In the app, tap on "Dev Wallet 4363"
2. You should see the wallet detail view with:
   - Account balance
   - Sync status/progress
   - Transaction list

### 3. Check Sync Progress
Look for indicators that sync is working:
- **Sync percentage should be > 0%**
- Status message like "Downloading headers" or "Syncing"
- Progress bar showing movement

### 4. Verify Settings
1. Tap the "Settings" tab (gear icon at bottom right)
2. Look for "Network Settings" or "Peer Configuration"
3. Verify:
   - "Use Local Peers" toggle is OFF
   - Local peer host shows "127.0.0.1"
   - No reference to "192.168.1.163"

### 5. Monitor Console Output
Open Console.app and filter for "DashPay" to see:
- Peer connection messages
- Header download progress
- Network activity

## Expected Results

### ✅ Success Indicators
- Sync progress moves past 0%
- Console shows "Connected to X peers" (where X > 0)
- Headers start downloading
- No connection attempts to 192.168.1.163

### ❌ Failure Indicators
- Sync stuck at 0%
- Console shows "No peers connected"
- Errors mentioning 192.168.1.163
- Network timeout errors

## Screenshots Taken
- `test_peer_connectivity_launch.png` - Initial launch
- `test_wallet_created.png` - After wallet creation
- `test_wallet_opened.png` - Wallet list view
- `test_sync_status.png` - Current state

## Next Steps
1. Manually interact with the app to verify sync
2. Take screenshots of sync progress
3. Check console logs for peer connections
4. Document whether sync progresses past 0%

## Code Changes Applied
All peer connectivity fixes have been successfully applied:
- Removed hardcoded peer (192.168.1.163)
- Default to public peers
- Configurable local peer settings
- Fixed SPVEvent handling in WalletService

The app is ready for manual sync verification!
