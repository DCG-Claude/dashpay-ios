# SDK Initialization Pattern Alignment

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to align the dashpay-ios SDK initialization pattern with the rust-dashcore implementation to resolve sync issues.

## Key Differences Addressed

### 1. Data Directory Configuration
**Problem**: dashpay-ios was not configuring a data directory for SPV persistence.
**Solution**: Added data directory setup in `WalletService.swift`:
```swift
config.dataDirectory = documentsPath.appendingPathComponent("DashSPV").appendingPathComponent(wallet.network.rawValue)
```

### 2. SDK Component Architecture
**Problem**: dashpay-ios was only initializing DashSDK without StorageManager and PersistentWalletManager.
**Solution**: Created proper component initialization following rust-dashcore pattern:
- StorageManager - Handles SwiftData persistence
- SPVClient - Direct SPV network operations
- PersistentWalletManager - Manages wallet data with persistence
- DashSDK - High-level wrapper (when available)

### 3. Log Level Configuration
**Problem**: Missing trace-level logging for debugging.
**Solution**: Added `config.logLevel = "trace"` for detailed sync debugging.

## Files Created

1. **StorageManager.swift** - SwiftData-based persistence layer
   - Manages Transaction, UTXO, Balance, and WatchedAddress models
   - Provides batch operations and statistics

2. **PersistentWalletManager.swift** - Wallet management with persistence
   - Coordinates between SPVClient and StorageManager
   - Handles address watching with storage
   - Provides periodic sync capabilities

3. **Transaction.swift** - SwiftData model for transactions
4. **UTXO.swift** - SwiftData model for unspent transaction outputs

## Files Modified

1. **WalletService.swift**
   - Added StorageManager and PersistentWalletManager properties
   - Updated initialization to create all components
   - Modified connection logic to use SPVClient directly
   - Updated address watching to use PersistentWalletManager
   - Fixed compilation errors:
     - Changed `DashSDKError.connectionFailed` to `.networkError` 
     - Fixed Balance type conversion with `Balance.from(sdkBalance)`
     - Resolved unused variable warnings

2. **SimplifiedWalletService.swift**
   - Fixed duplicate WalletError enum
   - Fixed sync progress callbacks with proper actor isolation
   - Updated SDK method calls (watchAddress instead of addWatchAddress)

## Key Implementation Details

### Initialization Flow
```swift
// 1. Create StorageManager for persistence
let storageManager = try StorageManager()

// 2. Create SPVClient
let client = SPVClient(configuration: config)

// 3. Create PersistentWalletManager
let walletManager = PersistentWalletManager(client: client, storage: storageManager)

// 4. Create DashSDK wrapper (if available)
let dashSDK = try DashSDK(configuration: config)
```

### Connection Flow
```swift
// Start SPV client
try await client.start()

// Start periodic sync
persistentWalletManager?.startPeriodicSync()
```

## Build Status

After the alignment changes:
- ✅ **WalletService.swift** - All compilation errors fixed
- ✅ **SimplifiedWalletService.swift** - Builds successfully with warnings
- ✅ **StorageManager.swift** - Builds successfully
- ✅ **PersistentWalletManager.swift** - Builds successfully
- ✅ **Transaction.swift** & **UTXO.swift** - Build successfully

Remaining non-critical issues:
- Some Swift 6 concurrency warnings about non-sendable types
- SyncDebugView.swift has unrelated errors that need separate attention

## Expected Benefits

1. **Persistent Sync State**: Headers and filters are now saved between sessions
2. **Faster Subsequent Syncs**: No need to re-download data
3. **Better Error Recovery**: Failed operations can be retried from saved state
4. **Improved Debugging**: Trace logs provide detailed sync information

## Next Steps

1. Test the sync functionality with these changes
2. Verify data persistence across app restarts
3. Monitor sync performance improvements
4. Consider additional optimizations based on trace logs
5. Address remaining SyncDebugView.swift issues separately

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Clean install and first sync
- [ ] Sync resume after app restart
- [ ] Sync recovery after network failure
- [ ] Address watching persistence
- [ ] Transaction history persistence
- [ ] Balance calculation accuracy
