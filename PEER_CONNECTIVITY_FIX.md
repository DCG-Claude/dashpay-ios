# Peer Connectivity Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was unable to sync because it was hardcoded to use a local peer at IP address 192.168.1.163, which was not accessible. This prevented the wallet from downloading headers and syncing with the Dash network.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Local Peer from App Initialization
- **File**: `DashPayiOS/App/DashPayApp.swift`
- **Change**: Removed the line `config.additionalPeers = ["192.168.1.163:19999"]` that was forcing all connections to use a specific local peer
- **Result**: The app now respects the peer configuration settings

### 2. Made Local Peer Configuration Flexible
- **File**: `DashPayiOS/Core/Services/WalletService.swift`
- **Changes**:
  - Changed hardcoded IP (192.168.1.163) to configurable host via UserDefaults
  - Default local peer is now localhost (127.0.0.1) which is more standard
  - Added methods to get/set custom local peer host for development flexibility

### 3. Enhanced Settings UI
- **File**: `DashPayiOS/Core/Views/SettingsView.swift`
- **Changes**:
  - Shows current local peer host in the UI
  - Added warning message when using local peers
  - Helps users understand they can toggle to public peers if sync is blocked

### 4. Set Default to Public Peers
- **File**: `DashPayiOS/App/DashPayApp.swift`
- **Change**: Added first-launch detection to ensure the app defaults to public peers
- **Result**: New installations will automatically use public Dash network peers

## How It Works Now

### Public Peers (Default)
When "Use Local Peers" is OFF (default):
- Uses official Dash testnet/mainnet peers from SPVClientConfiguration
- Allows proper network discovery and sync
- Headers should start downloading immediately

### Local Peers (Development)
When "Use Local Peers" is ON:
- Uses configurable local peer (default: 127.0.0.1)
- Developers can set custom host via `walletService.setLocalPeerHost("192.168.x.x")`
- Shows warning in Settings that local peers may block sync

## Testing the Fix

1. **Check Current Configuration**:
   ```bash
   ./test_peer_config.swift
   ```

2. **In the App**:
   - Go to Settings
   - Ensure "Use Local Peers" is OFF
   - Create/import a wallet
   - Sync should start and headers should begin downloading

3. **For Local Development**:
   - Run a local Dash node
   - Toggle "Use Local Peers" ON in Settings
   - App will connect to localhost:19999 (testnet) or localhost:9999 (mainnet)

## Key Benefits
- ✅ No more hardcoded IPs blocking sync
- ✅ Easy toggle between local and public peers
- ✅ Configurable local peer host for different development setups
- ✅ Clear UI warnings about peer configuration
- ✅ Automatic fallback from local to public peers if connection fails
