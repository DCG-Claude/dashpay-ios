# FFI Initialization Investigation Report

## Executive Summary
Investigation into the hypothesis that FFI functions are not being properly initialized or linked at runtime, preventing the SPV client from starting.

## Key Findings

### 1. FFI Initialization Architecture
The FFI initialization follows this flow:
1. **DashPayApp.swift** → Creates UnifiedAppState
2. **UnifiedAppState** → Creates DashSDK with SPVClientConfiguration
3. **DashSDK.swift** → Creates SPVClient, attempts FFI initialization if needed
4. **SPVClient.swift** → Uses FFIInitializer to ensure FFI is ready
5. **FFIInitializer.swift** → Handles actual FFI library initialization with retry logic

### 2. FFI Libraries Present
Multiple FFI libraries found in the project:
- `libdash_spv_ffi_sim.a` (Simulator)
- `libdash_spv_ffi_ios.a` (Device)
- `librs_sdk_ffi.a` (Platform SDK)
- Renamed versions to avoid symbol conflicts

### 3. Initialization Issues Identified

#### A. FFI Initialization Timing
- FFI initialization happens during SPVClient creation
- Uses `dash_spv_ffi_init_logging()` to initialize the Rust logging system
- Has retry logic with up to 3 attempts
- Includes timeout protection (5 seconds per attempt)

#### B. Library Loading Verification
FFIInitializer performs these checks:
```swift
// First verify FFI library is loaded
if let versionPtr = dash_spv_ffi_version() {
    // Library is loaded
} else {
    // Library not loaded - critical linking issue
}
```

#### C. Error Handling
The system handles multiple error scenarios:
- Already initialized (treated as success)
- Initialization timeout
- Library not found
- Rust panics

### 4. Potential Root Causes

#### A. Symbol Conflicts
- Multiple FFI libraries (SPV and Platform) may have conflicting symbols
- Renamed libraries suggest previous attempts to resolve conflicts

#### B. Linking Issues
- Missing `-force_load` flags in build settings
- Libraries not properly linked for simulator vs device builds
- Architecture mismatches (arm64 vs x86_64)

#### C. Initialization Race Conditions
- FFI initialization might be called from multiple threads
- Protected by DispatchQueue but still possible timing issues

#### D. Runtime Library Loading
- Dynamic library loading failures
- Missing dependencies
- Incorrect library paths

### 5. Diagnostic Tools Available
- **FFIDebugView.swift** - UI for testing FFI initialization
- **FFIDiagnostics.swift** - Comprehensive FFI diagnostic report
- **FFIInitializer** - Detailed logging of initialization process

### 6. Current Initialization Flow Analysis

From DashSDK.swift:
```swift
// Line 66-87: SPVClient creation and FFI verification
self.client = SPVClient(configuration: configuration)

// Verify FFI is initialized
if !FFIInitializer.initialized {
    // Attempt manual initialization with retry
    try FFIInitializer.initializeWithRetry(...)
}
```

From SPVClient.swift:
```swift
// Line 459-495: FFI initialization in SPVClient constructor
if !FFIInitializer.initialized {
    do {
        try FFIInitializer.initializeWithRetry(logLevel: configuration.logLevel, maxAttempts: 3)
    } catch {
        // Log detailed error information
    }
}
```

### 7. Recommendations

1. **Verify Library Linking**
   - Check Xcode build settings for `-force_load` flags
   - Ensure correct libraries are linked for simulator/device

2. **Test FFI Initialization Directly**
   - Use FFIDebugView to test initialization in isolation
   - Run FFIDiagnostics.runDiagnostics() for detailed report

3. **Check for Symbol Conflicts**
   - Use `nm` command to check for duplicate symbols
   - Verify renamed libraries are properly configured

4. **Add More Diagnostics**
   - Log FFI library version on startup
   - Add dlopen/dlsym checks for runtime verification
   - Monitor for Rust panics or segfaults

5. **Initialization Order**
   - Ensure FFI is initialized before any SDK usage
   - Consider moving initialization earlier in app lifecycle

## Conclusion
The FFI initialization system is well-designed with retry logic and error handling, but runtime linking issues or symbol conflicts may be preventing proper initialization. The presence of renamed libraries and multiple FFI implementations suggests ongoing efforts to resolve conflicts. Further investigation should focus on build configuration and runtime library loading verification.
