# Final Analysis: DashPay iOS Sync Issue

## Executive Summary

The sync issue where "connected_peers: 0" is shown despite active connections is likely caused by **outdated FFI libraries** in the DashPay iOS app.

## Evidence

### 1. Different Library Versions
- **Working example** (rust-dashcore): 
  - libdash_spv_ffi_sim.a: 100,839,696 bytes (June 30, 2025)
- **DashPay iOS**: 
  - libdash_spv_ffi_sim.a: 51,234,328 bytes (June 28, 2025)

The working example has libraries that are nearly **2x larger** and **2 days newer**.

### 2. Code Analysis Shows No Significant Differences
- Both apps use the same `SPVClient` from SwiftDashCoreSDK
- Both set up event callbacks properly
- Both use identical configuration and peer lists
- Both follow the same connection flow

### 3. The Bug is in the FFI Layer
The issue is in the `peer_count()` implementation which uses `block_in_place` with nested `block_on`. This pattern can fail in certain runtime contexts, returning 0 instead of the actual peer count.

## Root Cause

The older FFI libraries in DashPay iOS likely have a bug in the `MultiPeerManager::peer_count()` method that was fixed in the newer version used by the working example.

## Solution

### Immediate Fix
1. Copy the newer FFI libraries from the working example:
```bash
cp /Users/quantum/src/rust-dashcore/swift-dash-core-sdk/Examples/DashHDWalletExample/libdash_spv_ffi*.a \
   /Users/quantum/src/dashpay-ios/DashPayiOS/Libraries/
```

2. Rebuild the DashPay iOS app with the updated libraries

### Long-term Fix
1. Set up a proper build process to ensure FFI libraries are always up-to-date
2. Consider using the rust-dashcore build script:
```bash
cd /Users/quantum/src/rust-dashcore/swift-dash-core-sdk
./build-ios.sh
```

### Verification
After updating the libraries:
1. The "FFI Stats Debug" should show actual peer counts
2. Sync should proceed normally
3. The app should behave like the working example

## Alternative Workaround (if library update doesn't work)

Modify the sync logic to bypass the peer count check:
```swift
// In WalletService.swift
func startSyncIgnoringPeerCount() async throws {
    guard isConnected else { throw WalletError.notConnected }
    
    // Log warning but proceed
    logger.warning("Starting sync without peer count verification")
    
    // Wait briefly for connections to stabilize
    try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 3_000_000_000) // 3 seconds
    
    // Start sync regardless of reported peer count
    try await startSyncWithCallbacks()
}
```

## Conclusion

The issue is not in the Swift code but in the outdated Rust FFI libraries. The peer_count() method in the older library has a bug that causes it to return 0 even when peers are connected. Updating to the newer FFI libraries should resolve the issue.
