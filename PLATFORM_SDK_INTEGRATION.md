# Platform SDK Integration Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Network Type Mapping
- Fixed PlatformNetwork enum to use correct DashSDKNetwork values
- Updated sdkNetwork property to return `.Mainnet`, `.Testnet`, `.Devnet`
- Removed ambiguous Network typealias

### 2. ✅ FFI Module Import
- Successfully imported DashSDKFFI module (already provided by xcframework)
- Removed duplicate CDashSDKFFI module that was causing conflicts
- Fixed module redefinition errors

### 3. ✅ PlatformSDKProtocol Interface
- Defined complete protocol with all required methods:
  - `fetchIdentity(id:)`
  - `createIdentity(with:)`
  - `topUpIdentity(_:with:)`
  - `transferCredits(from:to:amount:)`
  - `createDocument(contractId:ownerId:documentType:data:)`

### 4. ✅ FFI Call Implementations
- Implemented fetchIdentity with proper error handling
- Implemented createIdentity with asset lock proof encoding
- Implemented transferCredits with FFI call pattern
- Implemented createDocument with JSON data conversion
- All methods follow proper FFI memory management patterns

### 5. ✅ Project Configuration
- Updated project.yml with correct library search paths
- Added DashSDK.xcframework to the project dependencies
- Configured SWIFT_INCLUDE_PATHS correctly

## Current Status

The Platform SDK wrapper is now properly structured with:
- Correct FFI imports from DashSDKFFI module
- Proper error handling and memory management patterns
- Mock FFI functions as temporary placeholders
- Full protocol compliance with PlatformSDKProtocol

## Remaining Work

### 1. Replace Mock FFI Functions
The following functions are currently mocked and need real FFI implementations when the library is fully linked:
- `dash_sdk_create`
- `dash_sdk_fetch_identity`
- `dash_sdk_identity_create_with_asset_lock`
- `dash_sdk_transfer_credits`
- `dash_sdk_document_create`

### 2. Asset Lock Proof Encoding
The current `encodeAssetLockProof` method uses JSON encoding. This needs to be replaced with the proper binary encoding format expected by the Platform.

### 3. Signer Integration
The signer handle is currently a stub. Need to implement:
- Proper signer creation via FFI
- Connect signer to SDK instance
- Key management for identity operations

### 4. Testing
- Integration tests with actual Platform network
- Memory leak tests
- Error handling edge cases
- Cross-layer operation tests

## Migration Path

To complete the integration:

1. **Link FFI Library**: Ensure librs_sdk_ffi.a is properly linked for both simulator and device architectures

2. **Remove Mock Functions**: Once FFI is linked, remove the private mock functions and use the real FFI calls

3. **Test on Testnet**: Use the configured testnet DAPI addresses to test real Platform operations

4. **Production Readiness**: Add retry logic, better error messages, and telemetry

## Key Files Modified

- `/DashPayiOS/Shared/Bridges/PlatformSDKWrapper.swift` - Main SDK wrapper implementation
- `/DashPayiOS/Platform/Models/PlatformNetwork.swift` - Network enum with SDK mapping
- `/DashPayiOS/Shared/Bridges/AssetLockBridge.swift` - Protocol definitions
- `/project.yml` - Build configuration

## Architecture Benefits

The current implementation provides:
- Clean separation between Swift and FFI layers
- Type-safe wrapper around C functions
- Async/await API for Platform operations
- Proper memory management with automatic cleanup
- Mock capability for development without FFI
