# WalletService Simplification Summary

## Overview
The `WalletService.swift` file has been simplified to match the rust-dashcore implementation pattern by removing over-engineered connection management features.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Removed Complex Retry Logic
- **Removed**: `retryConnection()` method with exponential backoff
- **Removed**: `handlePeerConnectivityIssue()` automatic peer fallback
- **Removed**: `scheduleWatchAddressRetry()` for failed address watching
- **Why**: The rust-dashcore implementation uses simple async/await without retries

### 2. Simplified Connection Flow
- **Before**: Complex connection with network monitoring, peer fallback, and retry logic
- **After**: Direct `connect()` method that simply initializes SDK and connects
- **Why**: Matches rust-dashcore's straightforward connection approach

### 3. Removed Network Monitoring
- **Removed**: `NetworkMonitor` dependency
- **Removed**: Network connectivity checks before operations
- **Why**: Let connection failures surface naturally as errors

### 4. Simplified Error Handling
- **Removed**: Complex watch address error tracking (`watchAddressErrors`, `pendingWatchCount`, `watchVerificationStatus`)
- **Removed**: Watch verification timer and periodic checks
- **After**: Simple error logging without retry mechanisms
- **Why**: Keep error handling minimal like rust-dashcore

### 5. Streamlined Sync Methods
- **Removed**: Extensive logging and debug output
- **Simplified**: Direct callback-based sync without complex state management
- **Why**: Match rust-dashcore's simple sync approach

### 6. Cleaned Up Diagnostics
- **Removed**: Complex connectivity diagnostics (`diagnoseLocalPeerConnectivity`, `testHostReachability`)
- **Removed**: `ConnectionStatus` struct
- **After**: Simple `runDiagnostics()` method with basic status info
- **Why**: Diagnostics should be simple and focused

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Easier to understand and maintain
2. **Better Error Visibility**: Errors surface immediately instead of being masked by retries
3. **Predictable Behavior**: No automatic fallbacks or retries that might hide issues
4. **Matches rust-dashcore**: Consistent approach across implementations

## Migration Notes

- The simplified service maintains the same public API
- Core functionality (connect, sync, wallet management) remains unchanged
- Error handling is now more direct - callers should handle failures appropriately
- Network issues will result in immediate errors rather than automatic retries

## Alternative Implementation

A `SimplifiedWalletService.swift` file was also created as a reference implementation showing an even more minimal approach, which can be used as a starting point for future refactoring.
