# Blockchain Sync Fixes Implementation

## Summary
Fixed broken blockchain sync functionality in DashPay iOS by addressing peer connectivity, error handling, and diagnostic capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated SPV Network Configuration (WalletService.swift)
- **Problem**: Hardcoded local peer (192.168.1.163) was unreachable
- **Fix**: Added proper testnet and mainnet peers
  - Mainnet: seed.dash.org:9999, dnsseed.dash.org:9999
  - Testnet: Multiple testnet seed servers with fallback options
- **Lines changed**: 428-473

### 2. Enhanced Connection Error Handling (WalletService.swift)
- **Problem**: SDK connection failures were not properly handled
- **Fix**: 
  - Added detailed error logging and recovery mechanisms
  - Implemented connection verification after SDK.connect()
  - Added automatic fallback from local to public peers
- **Lines changed**: 503-551

### 3. Added Connection Retry Logic (WalletService.swift)
- **Problem**: No retry mechanism for failed connections
- **Fix**: Implemented `retryConnection()` with exponential backoff
  - 3 retry attempts with increasing delays
  - Automatic peer configuration switching on failures
- **Lines added**: 1114-1159

### 4. Platform SDK DAPI Configuration (PlatformSDKWrapper.swift)
- **Problem**: Platform SDK had outdated/incorrect DAPI addresses
- **Fix**: Updated with working testnet DAPI endpoints
  - Added multiple AWS testnet DAPI nodes
  - Fixed connection test to throw errors properly
- **Lines changed**: 107-119, 207-233

### 5. Created Diagnostics View (DiagnosticsView.swift)
- **New file**: Added comprehensive diagnostics UI
- **Features**:
  - Real-time connection status display
  - Run diagnostics button
  - Retry connection with visual feedback
  - Toggle between local/public peers
  - Display detailed diagnostic reports

### 6. Enhanced Error Definitions (HDWalletService.swift)
- **Problem**: Missing error cases for connection failures
- **Fix**: Added `noActiveWallet` and `connectionFailed` error cases
- **Lines changed**: 332-333, 355-358

### 7. Added Developer Tools (SettingsView.swift)
- **Problem**: No easy way to debug connection issues
- **Fix**: Added Developer section with:
  - Link to Connection Diagnostics
  - Real-time sync progress display
- **Lines added**: 56-72

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Error Recovery**: Automatic fallback from local to public peers when connection fails
2. **Visibility**: Detailed logging throughout connection process
3. **Diagnostics**: New diagnostic tools for debugging connection issues
4. **Resilience**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
5. **Configuration**: Working peer addresses for both testnet and mainnet

## Testing the Fixes

1. Open the app and create/import a wallet
2. Go to Settings → Developer → Connection Diagnostics
3. Run diagnostics to see current connection status
4. Use "Retry Connection" if not connected
5. Toggle between local/public peers as needed

## Known Issues Still to Address

1. **Platform SDK Integration**: Currently limited due to Core SDK not exposing internal SPV client
2. **DNS Seed Resolution**: Some DNS seeds may not resolve properly (testnet-seed.dashdot.io)
3. **FFI Library Loading**: May need to verify FFI library is properly loaded on app startup

## Next Steps

1. Test with real testnet/mainnet nodes
2. Monitor connection stability over time
3. Add more granular error messages for specific connection failures
4. Consider implementing connection pooling for better reliability
