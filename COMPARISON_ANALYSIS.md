# Comparison Analysis: Working Example vs DashPay iOS

## Key Differences Found

### 1. Connection Flow

**Working Example (rust-dashcore)**:
```swift
// WalletDetailView.swift
.onAppear {
    // Auto-connect if not connected
    if !walletService.isConnected || walletService.activeWallet != wallet {
        Task {
            print("üîÑ Auto-connecting wallet...")
            connectWallet()
        }
    }
}
```
- **Auto-connects on view appear**
- Sync is manually triggered by user clicking "Sync" button

**DashPay iOS**:
```swift
// WalletDetailView.swift  
.onAppear {
    // Don't auto-connect - let user control the process
}
```
- **No auto-connect**
- User must manually click "Connect" then "Sync"

### 2. Configuration Differences

Both use identical configuration:
- Same peer lists
- Same network settings
- Same `SPVClientConfiguration`
- Both create `DashSDK` instance the same way

### 3. Data Directory Setup

**Working Example**: No explicit data directory setup
**DashPay iOS**: Sets up data directory explicitly:
```swift
config.dataDirectory = documentsPath.appendingPathComponent("DashSPV").appendingPathComponent(wallet.network.rawValue)
```

### 4. Sync Timeout

**Working Example**: No timeout in EnhancedSyncProgressView
**DashPay iOS**: 10-second timeout that shows error if no progress

### 5. The Critical Difference - When Stats Are Checked

Looking at the Swift SDK's SPVClient.start():
```swift
// Lines 742-770: Waits up to 30 seconds for peers
while totalWaitTime < maxWaitTime {
    await updateStats()
    
    if let stats = self.stats {
        if stats.connectedPeers > 0 {
            print("\nüéâ Successfully connected to \(stats.connectedPeers) peer(s)!")
            break
        }
    }
    
    // Wait 1 second before next check
    try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000)
    totalWaitTime += 1
    
    // Log every 5 seconds if still no peers
    if totalWaitTime % 5 == 0 && (stats?.connectedPeers ?? 0) == 0 {
        print("   [\(totalWaitTime)s] Still waiting for peer connections...")
    }
}
```

## The Real Issue

The SPVClient IS waiting for connections and checking stats every second for up to 30 seconds. The "FFI Stats Debug" output we see is from these checks during the waiting period.

### What's Actually Happening:

1. **Connection is established** (we see "SendHeaders2" in logs)
2. **Stats are checked every second** by SPVClient.start()
3. **Stats show 0 peers** for all 30 checks
4. **After 30 seconds**, SPVClient gives up and proceeds
5. **Sync can't start** because it thinks there are no peers

## Root Cause Validation

The issue is NOT:
- ‚ùå Event callbacks (they're set up correctly)
- ‚ùå Connection flow (both apps connect the same way)
- ‚ùå Configuration (identical)
- ‚ùå Timeout too short (SPVClient waits 30 seconds)

The issue IS:
- ‚úÖ **Stats reporting 0 peers even after connections are established**
- ‚úÖ This happens consistently for 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ The peer_count() method is returning 0 when it shouldn't

## Why It Works in the Example App

This is puzzling. Both apps use the same SDK, same configuration, same connection flow. The only differences are:
1. Auto-connect vs manual connect (shouldn't matter)
2. Data directory setup (might affect persistence but not peer count)

## Next Investigation Steps

1. Check if the working example actually works consistently or if it's intermittent
2. Add logging to see if peer_count() is even being called
3. Check if there's a difference in how the apps are built/linked
4. Verify the FFI libraries are identical between the two apps
