# Remaining Work for DashPay iOS Build

## Progress Summary

I've successfully resolved most of the build errors in the DashPay iOS project. The project started with 100+ errors and has been reduced significantly through systematic fixes.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Type Consolidation**: Removed duplicate type definitions across the codebase
2. **Module Organization**: Fixed import issues and type visibility
3. **Mock Implementations**: Added temporary implementations for FFI functions
4. **SwiftUI Fixes**: Resolved various SwiftUI-related type inference issues
5. **Model Corrections**: Fixed SwiftData model definitions and relationships

## Remaining Issues

The project still has some compilation errors related to:

1. **Type Visibility**: Some types like Balance properties (instantLocked, mempool) are not available in certain contexts due to multiple Balance type definitions
2. **SDK Methods**: Some SDK methods like validateAddress and estimateFee need proper linking
3. **FFI Integration**: The FFI libraries need to be properly configured in Xcode as documented

## Next Steps

1. **Configure FFI Libraries in Xcode**:
   - Add Framework Search Paths: `$(SRCROOT)/DashPayiOS/Libraries`
   - Add Library Search Paths for device and simulator
   - Link the .a files in Build Phases
   - Configure module maps for DashSDKFFI

2. **Resolve Type Conflicts**:
   - Ensure consistent Balance type usage across the app
   - Fix remaining property access issues

3. **Complete SDK Integration**:
   - Replace mock implementations with real FFI calls
   - Properly link DashSDK methods

## Build Instructions

Once the FFI libraries are configured in Xcode:

1. Open DashPayiOS.xcodeproj in Xcode
2. Follow the instructions in XCODE_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md
3. Build for iOS Simulator

The codebase structure is solid and follows Swift best practices. The remaining work is primarily configuration and final type resolution.
