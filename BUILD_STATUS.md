# DashPay iOS Build Status

## âœ… BUILD SUCCESSFUL

The DashPay iOS project now successfully builds using Xcode terminal utilities.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Network Type Conflicts**
- Fixed the conflict between `DashNetwork` and `KeyWalletFFI.Network` types
- Updated `keyWalletNetwork` property to correctly map `.mainnet` to `.dash`

### 2. **SPVClient Compatibility**
- Added missing properties: `syncProgress`, `stats`
- Added missing methods: `start()`, `stop()`, `syncToTip()`, `rescanBlockchain()`, etc.
- Added `SyncProgressStream` implementation
- Added `DetailedSyncProgress` initializer
- Added properties to `SyncStage`: `description`, `icon`, `isActive`

### 3. **Missing Types**
- Added `statusMessage` and `statistics` to `DetailedSyncProgress`
- Fixed `SPVEvent` to include all expected cases
- Fixed `MempoolRemovalReason` type in SPVEvent

### 4. **DashSDK Configuration**
- Added storage of `configuration` property in DashSDK
- Added `addWatchItem` and `removeWatchItem` methods

### 5. **Import and Module Issues**
- Fixed `validateMnemonic` to use the correct module reference
- Fixed ambiguous `WatchItemType` by removing duplicate definition

### 6. **Workarounds Applied**
- TransactionBuilder.swift - Not added to Xcode project, so inline implementations were used
- AddressDiscoveryService.swift - Not added to Xcode project, so inline discovery logic was implemented

## Files Modified

1. `DashPayiOS/SwiftDashCoreSDK/Models/Network.swift` - Fixed Network type mapping
2. `DashPayiOS/SwiftDashCoreSDK/Core/SPVClient.swift` - Added compatibility layer
3. `DashPayiOS/Core/Services/HDWalletService.swift` - Fixed validateMnemonic reference
4. `DashPayiOS/SwiftDashCoreSDK/Core/DashSDKError.swift` - Added missing error cases
5. `DashPayiOS/SwiftDashCoreSDK/DashSDK.swift` - Added configuration storage and methods
6. `DashPayiOS/SwiftDashCoreSDK/Wallet/WalletManager.swift` - Simplified UTXO selection
7. `DashPayiOS/Core/Services/WalletService.swift` - Inline address discovery

## Files Created

1. `DashPayiOS/Core/Services/AddressDiscoveryService.swift` - Address discovery implementation
2. `DashPayiOS/SwiftDashCoreSDK/Transaction/TransactionBuilder.swift` - Transaction building logic

## Next Steps

1. **Add Created Files to Xcode Project**: The TransactionBuilder.swift and AddressDiscoveryService.swift files need to be added to the Xcode project file for full integration.

2. **Test the Application**: Run the app on simulator/device to ensure all functionality works correctly.

3. **Complete Transaction Signing**: The transaction building currently returns empty data - this needs to be completed with actual FFI transaction construction.

4. **Remove Workarounds**: Once the files are properly added to the project, remove the inline implementations and use the proper classes.
