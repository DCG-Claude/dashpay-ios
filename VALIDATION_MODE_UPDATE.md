# Validation Mode Update Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to enable full validation mode in dashpay-ios to match the rust-dashcore example app configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. SPVClientConfiguration.swift
- Changed default validation mode from `.basic` to `.full` (line 8)
- Updated testnet configuration:
  - Changed `config.validationMode` from `.none` to `.full` (line 323)
  - Changed `config.enableFilterLoad` from `false` to `true` (line 322)
- Updated regtest configuration:
  - Changed `config.validationMode` from `.none` to `.full` (line 330)
  - Added `config.enableFilterLoad = true` (line 331)

### 2. AppState.swift
- Updated enhanced SPV configuration:
  - Changed `config.validationMode` from `.basic` to `.full` (line 341)
- Updated minimal SPV configuration (fallback):
  - Changed `config.validationMode` from `.none` to `.basic` (line 385)
  - Changed `config.enableFilterLoad` from `false` to `true` (line 389)

### 3. DashPayApp.swift
- Changed `config.validationMode` from `.basic` to `.full` (line 130)

### 4. WalletService.swift
- Already using `.full` validation mode (no changes needed)

### 5. SettingsConfigurationTests.swift
- Updated test expectation for regtest from `.none` to `.full` (line 134)

## Summary

All validation mode configurations have been updated to use full validation (`.full`) by default, with the exception of the minimal fallback configuration which uses basic validation (`.basic`) as a minimum. Filter loading has been enabled (`enableFilterLoad = true`) everywhere it was previously disabled, as this is required for proper validation.

These changes align dashpay-ios with the rust-dashcore example app configuration, which should improve blockchain validation and security.
